# Store

This folder contains the global state management setup.

### Examples

- Redux Toolkit store and slices
- Zustand stores
- Context Providers

### Guidelines

- Keep feature-specific state in the feature folder where possible.
- Use global state sparingly and only for truly global data (e.g., auth session, theme).
