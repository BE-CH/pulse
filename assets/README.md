# Assets

This folder contains all static assets used in the app, such as images, fonts, icons, and other media.

### Structure

- `/images` — PNG, JPEG, SVG, WebP files.
- `/fonts` — Custom font files.
- `/icons` — Icon assets (if not using an icon library).

### Guidelines

- Optimize images before adding.
- Use consistent naming (e.g., `feature-name-action.png`).
- Organize into subfolders by type or feature if necessary.
