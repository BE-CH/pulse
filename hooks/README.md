# Hooks

This folder contains **reusable custom React hooks**.

Hooks here should be **global** and not tied to a specific feature.

### Examples

- useNetworkStatus
- useDebounce
- useTheme

### Guidelines

- Prefix with `use`.
- If a hook is specific to a single feature, keep it inside that feature folder instead.
