# Constants

This folder contains app-wide constant values, enums, and configuration objects.

### Examples

- API endpoints
- Theme constants
- Enum definitions

### Guidelines

- Group constants logically.
- Do not hardcode feature-specific values here â€” keep those in the relevant feature folder.
