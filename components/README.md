# Components

This folder contains **reusable, generic UI components** used throughout the app.

These are **presentational components** that do not include business logic.

### Examples

- Button
- Card
- TextInput
- Modal
- Spinner

### Guidelines

- Must be reusable and not specific to a single feature.
- Should have props with INTERFACES that make them flexible but easy to use.
- Style with theme variables where possible.
