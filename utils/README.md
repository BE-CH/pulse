# Utils

This folder contains general utility and helper functions.

These are pure functions with no side effects and no React-specific code.

### Examples

- Date formatting
- String manipulation
- Validation functions

### Guidelines

- Keep functions small and testable.
- Group by domain if the folder grows too large.
